# budget-sliders-react

# to DO

# Slider Issues:
Lock locked sliders or change function, currenty if you modify a locked slider the other sliders will change as if
the budget of the locked slider is not included

Make it impossible to get negative values

Cost as double, (or look into banking values)

Have only two decimal places for cost, have quantity as integers

Cost change is not smooth, fix

# CSS:
Add logical class names
Add CSS to prettify

# D3: 
Add spot for D3
Figure out D3, useEffect,
Add pi graphs, bar graphs that change w/ smooth animations

# Bonus:
Add cookies to initilize state
